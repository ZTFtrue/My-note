## Iterator v.s. iteratee

An iterator calls an iteratee, in this case a callback. In async it'd be confusing if we named the iteratee a callback as most iteratees pass a callback to indicate(暗示) completion.

For some background here is the async.js issue where this was discussed and it's also the way we specify the iterator callbacks in lodash and underscore(强调). This underscore thread is the basis of the changes in of the three libraries.

## [i++ 与 ++i](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24853/what-is-the-difference-between-i-and-i)

`++i` will increment the value of i, and then return the incremented value.

```js
 i = 1;
 j = ++i;
// i == 2, j == 2
```

`i++` will increment the value of i, but return the original value that i held before being incremented.

```js
 i = 1;
 j = i++;
 (i is 2, j is 1)
```

For a for loop, either works. ++i seems more common( 常见), perhaps because that is what is used in K&R.

In any case, follow the guideline "prefer ++i over i++" and you won't go wrong.

[Is there a performance difference between i++ and ++i if the resulting value is not used?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24886/is-there-a-performance-difference-between-i-and-i-in-c)

Executive summary: No.

i++ could potentially be slower than ++i, since the old value of i might need to be saved for later use, but in practice all modern compilers will optimize this away.

We can demonstrate(证明) this by looking at the code for this function, both with ++i and i++.
