## 随机数算法

### TRNG真随机数生成(true random number generator)

There are two principal methods used to generate random numbers. The first method measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Example sources include measuring atmospheric noise, thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena. For example, cosmic background radiation or radioactive decay as measured over short timescales represent sources of natural entropy (as a measure of unpredictability or surprise of the number generation process).

The second method uses computational algorithms that can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a pseudorandom number generator. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, though it may be periodically seeded by natural sources. This generator type is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility.

## 彩票抽奖系统设计

游戏抽卡算法不考虑

1. 用户选择一个号码 A, 并创建一个随机数 Π , 将号码A, 期号, 随机数 Π 合在一起进行 sha256 指纹计算. 将计算结果提交到数据中心.
2. 开奖后发布中奖号码为 B , 购买过彩票的用户上传自己的原始信息-彩票号码、期号、随机数. 数据中心验证.

这个方法在 <密码学> 里有类似讨论.
