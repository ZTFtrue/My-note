The Rubik's Cube can seem almost impossible when you first start playing with it.

当你第一次开始玩魔方时，你可能会觉得它几乎不可能玩。

Getting the first few pieces into place is easy enough but soon you find you can't do anything without stuffing up other areas. When you know the steps, and are armed with the right algorithms it is actually quite easy.

把前几块放到位很容易，但很快你就会发现，如果不把其他区域塞满，你就什么也做不了。当你知道步骤，并掌握正确的算法时，这实际上相当容易。

On the following pages you'll learn a simple and easy to apply set of algorithms (pre organised steps) which will solve the cube. (The Rubik's Cube is a product created by Rubik's Brand Ltd. This is merely a tutorial on how to solve it and is in no way affiliated with the company.)

### Getting to know your cube

Everyone picks up the Rubik's Cube differently.
每个人拿起魔方的方式都不同。

Some people will figure out manipulating the pieces fairly quickly. Others will take a little longer.
有些人会很快弄明白如何操作魔方。其他人则需要更长的时间。

With practice manipulating the pieces it will get easier and you will start to appreciate how certain moves result in certain outcomes.
随着操作魔方的练习，它会变得更容易，你会开始欣赏某些动作如何导致某些结果。

What at first seems like just blindly following algorithms (will start to make sense )(主语从句) and you'll start modifying the algorithms to create shortcuts.
开始看似盲目遵循算法 后来就开始变得有意义了，你会开始修改算法来创建捷径。

Before we begin working on solving the cube it can be beneficial to get a feel for how the cube behaves.
在我们开始解魔方之前，先了解一下魔方的行为方式是很有益处的。

A good starting exercise is to work on solving just a single face of the cube.
一个好的开始练习是只解决立方体的一个面。

Don't worry if the squares adjoining that face don't line up correctly, just work on solving a single face.
如果与该面相邻的方块没有正确排列，请不要担心，只需解决一个面即可。

You should be able to do this intuitively (that is without using predefined algorithms).
您应该能够直观地做到这一点（即不使用预定义的算法）。

Doing this helps to build an understanding of how the pieces move around and how pieces can be put into place without affecting others.
这样做有助于了解棋子如何移动，以及如何将棋子放到合适的位置而不影响其他棋子。

You should practice holding the cube in two hands whilst(conj. 同时；时时，有时；当…的时候) doing this and manipulating the cube with both hands.
您应该练习用双手握住魔方，同时用双手操纵魔方。

For extra challenge, see if you can solve the cube face one handed.

#### Pieces of the cube

There are three different types of pieces that make up your Rubiks Cube.

    - Corner pieces - There are 8 corner pieces. They have 3 panels and can each be in any of 3 orientations in each position. 角件 - 角件共有 8 个。它们有 3 个面板，每个面板在每个位置上可以处于 3 个方向中的任意一个。
    - Edge pieces - There are 12 edge pieces. They have 2 panels and can each be in any of 2 orientations. 边件 - 边件共有 12 个。它们有 2 个面板，每个面板可以处于 2 个方向中的任意一个。
    - Center pieces - There are 6 center pieces. They each have only one panel so can be in a single orientation. These pieces also identify the six faces of the cube. eg. the face with the blue center piece is the blue face.

All up this makes for 26 pieces making up the cube with a total of 54 panels on those pieces. 总共有 26 块立方体，每块立方体上有 54 个面板。

This leads to a staggering(adj. 蹒跚的；令人惊愕的；犹豫的, v. 蹒跚（stagger的ing形式）) 43, 252, 003, 274, 489, 856, 000 possible combinations.
 Despite this large number, a group or researchers with a heap of spare computing time actually worked out the optimal solve for each of these combinations working out that the maximum required number of moves (see below) to solve any cube is 20 moves.尽管数字很大，但一组研究人员利用大量的空闲计算时间，实际上为每一种组合找到了最优解，他们计算出解决任何魔方所需的最大移动次数（见下文）是 20 步。

Virtually all of these combinations required a different algorithm in order to sovle optimally and we are not going to propose you try to remember that many combinations and corresponding algorithms.
事实上，所有这些组合都需要不同的算法才能实现最佳解决方案，我们不会建议您尝试记住那么多组合和相应的算法。

Instead we are going to introduce you to the beginner algorithms.

They do involve more than 20 moves but they are guaranteed to solve any combination.

This is the power of well thought out algorithms, they can be very flexible in what they can solve. 这就是经过深思熟虑的算法的力量，它们可以非常灵活地解决它们所能解决的问题。

This is also why this Rubiks cube tutorial is on a website with IT tutorials.

Learning to solve the Rubiks cube is a great way to explore how we can effectively set up processes in order to take a wide range of possible inputs and reliably transform them into given outputs.学习解决魔方是探索如何有效地建立流程以便获取各种可能的输入并可靠地将它们转换为给定输出的好方法。

### Cube Notation(符号)

Solving the cube involves following a set of algorithms. To illustrate the algorithms we will use cube notation as listed below. (There are several variations on cube notation but once you know one, adjusting to others is fairly easy.)解决魔方需要遵循一组算法。为了说明这些算法，我们将使用下面列出的魔方符号。（魔方符号有几种变体，但一旦你知道一种，调整其他符号就相当容易了。）

Each of these moves is a 90 degree turn of the relevant pieces. Each move also has a corresponding opposite move which is denoted with an apostrophe ( ' ). 每一步都是将相关 块 旋转 90 度。每一步都有相应的反向移动，用撇号 (') 表示。

Don't worry about trying to remember all of these. The images as well as a simulation will be used along with the notation when explaining the algorithms.

Now you're ready. You can dive into Step 1 - Solving the white cross, or keep reading below if you're interested.

### Tips and Advice

It's not uncommon to feel a bit overwhelmed when first starting out with learning to solve the Rubik's Cube.
刚开始学习解魔方时，感到有点不知所措是很常见的。

With time and practice this will quickly subside. Here are some tips and advice to help you on your journey to cube mastery.
随着时间和练习，这种感觉会很快消退。以下是一些提示和建议，可帮助您掌握魔方。

    - Just do a little bit each day - if you start getting frustrated, leave it for a bit and come back the next day. A bit of time can often be great for helping to clarify things.
    - Repetition is good - the first few times you go over the algorithm for a step you'll probably need to follow the tutorial. But soon you'll start to remember it and will be able to do it on your own. Repetition will build muscle memory so you no longer need to consciously think about doing that step. This will free up valuable resources in your mind to devote to working on the next step.
    - Mix it up - Solve the cube a few times all the way making use of the tutorial as a reference, then do a few just up to the step you can remember by yourself.
    - You will make mistakes and stuff up your cube many times whilst learning. If this happens don't worry, you can try and undo your moves and have another go. Frequently you won't remember what moves you actually made and will just stuff it up even more in trying to undo them. No worries, just start again. It's all good practice.
    - Experiment - The algorithms for each step focus on placing particular pieces. They will also move other pieces around the cube. When learning a new algorithm take the time to look at other pieces on your cube and how they are moved around. This will help you better understand how the algorithm works and can also lead to shortcuts.

### Getting your time down

To begin with, you'll take quite a bit of time to solve the Rubik's cube. With practice it is possible to get this down well under a minute. Here are a few tips to help with this:
首先，你需要花相当多的时间来解开魔方。通过练习，你可以在一分钟内完成。以下是一些有助于解开魔方的技巧：

    - Work on making moves with your fingers rather than by twisting your wrists. This will allow you to make the moves much quicker and to string moves together in quick succession. 练习用手指而不是扭动手腕来做动作。这样可以让你更快地做出动作，并快速连续地将动作串联起来。
    - Get a speed cube (See below). These allow you to turn the pieces much easier than a standard Rubik's Cube and this will also help with getting your time down.准备一个魔方（见下文）。与标准魔方相比，魔方可以让你更轻松地转动方块，这也有助于缩短你的时间。
    - Learn the mirror images of algorithms. Most of the algorithms can be done as a mirror image and often this allows you to place a piece more efficiently.
    - Learn to perform the algorithms on faces other than the one facing you. This will reduce time spent turning the cube around to get the right face facing you and will reduce your time quite a bit.
    - Practice, practice, practice. This is by far the best way to improve and many of the above tips will start to happen naturally with practice.

## The White Cross

### Introduction

Similar to a lot of things in technology, solving the Rubik's cube is best done by breaking it down into a series of smaller problems and progressively working towards completion.
与技术中的许多事物类似，解决魔方的最好方法是将其分解为一系列较小的问题，然后逐步完成。

 In solving the cube we will start off with the top layer (the one with the white face) and progressively work towards the bottom layer (the one with the yellow face) layer by layer.
 在解决魔方时，我们将从顶层（白色面）开始，然后逐层逐步向底层（黄色面）努力。

The top layer will be solved in two steps, first create a white cross, then in step two we will insert the white corners.
顶层将分两步解决，首先创建一个白色十字，然后在第二步中插入白色角。

See if you can do this step intuitively (ie without using any algorithms). This is a good way to help build up your skill and familiarity with the cube. If you get stuck however read the advice below.看看你是否可以直观地完成这一步（即不使用任何算法）。这是一种帮助你提高技能和熟悉魔方的好方法。但是如果你遇到困难，请阅读下面的建议。

In creating the white cross, it is essential that the white edge pieces are aligned so that their coloured side matches up with the corresponding coloured center pieces as in the diagram above. 在制作白色十字架时，必须将白色边缘部分对齐，使其彩色面与相应的彩色中心部分相匹配，如上图所示

At this stage we don't need to worry at all about any of the other pieces so I've greyed them out.在此阶段，我们完全不需要担心任何其他部分，因此我将它们涂成灰色。

### The White Cross 1.step

Start by holding the cube with both hands with the white face on top (identified by it's center panel being white).

We will use the bottom layer (with yellow face) as a holding ground to manipulate our edge pieces before rotating them into position on the top layer.我们将使用底层（黄色面）作为固定基础来操纵边缘件，然后将它们旋转到顶层的位置。

For all of these, it doesn't matter the orientation of the edge piece (which side is white and which is coloured). We will fix that up in the next step if need be.对于所有这些，边缘块的方向（哪一侧是白色，哪一侧是彩色）并不重要。如果需要，我们将在下一步中修复它。

Now we will place each white edge piece one after the other. The order in which you place them doesn't matter.
现在我们将把每个白色边缘块一个接一个地摆放起来。摆放顺序无所谓。

    - Move the edge piece down to the bottom layer.
    - Rotate the bottom layer to align the piece directly below - the place on the white face where you want it to be.
    - Depending on if the white panel of the edge piece is facing down or to the side use one of the methods listed below to move it to it's correct position on the white face.根据边缘件的白色面板是朝下还是朝侧面，使用下面列出的方法之一将其移动到白色面上的正确位置。
    - Pick the next white edge piece to place.

Depending on whether your white edge piece ends up with the white panel on the yellow face or not there are two ways to slot it into place. 根据边缘件的白色面板是朝下还是朝侧面，使用下面列出的方法之一将其移动到白色面上的正确位置。

### if White panel on yellow face

This one is the easiest. Simply line it up directly below where you want to slot it in then rotate the corresponding side face 180 degrees and you're done.这个最简单。只需将其直接对准您想要插入的位置，然后将相应的侧面旋转 180 度即可。

### if White panel not on yellow face

This one is a little more difficult, but barely.

Instead of one 180 degree rotation we instead do three 90 degree rotations. 我们不是进行一次 180 度旋转，而是进行三次 90 度旋转。

We are going to slot the piece in rotating it through two of the side faces in order to twist it around so that the white panel is oriented the right way.我们将把这个部件插入到两个侧面，旋转它，使白色面板朝向正确的方向。

Line up your piece directly above where it should go then rotate it 90 degrees to the left.将您的作品直接排列在它应该去的位置上方，然后将其向左旋转 90 度。

This move works just the same if you rotate 90 degrees to the right as well.

### Getting Unstuck

Sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where you want to move a piece but doing so will move another piece you have already placed. Don't worry, this is easy to get past. 有时候，您可能会发现您想要移动一个块但另一个块已经放置了它。不要担心，这很容易通过。

Notice we were smart in what we did here. There were two options for moving the piece down to the bottom layer. The blue face could also have been rotated to get the piece down to the bottom layer. This would have had the effect of putting the piece in the wrong orientation (the white panel would not have been facing down). Often, choosing the right way to move a piece down to the bottom layer can orient the piece correctly in the process saving you some time.

### Taking things further

Although we are starting with the white face there is nothing stopping you from starting with another face. The cube is symmetrical on all three axis so it really doesn't matter which face you start from. Speed cubists often look at the whole cube and start with the side which is quickest to solve which can save you a good few seconds with a bit of experience. Practice creating the cross (and the other steps as you learn them) starting from faces other than the white face so you can easily adapt.

Another good thing to try is to see if you can place the four edges without reorienting the cube. That is, if you start off with the red face pointing at you (for instance), keep the red face pointing at you at all times. This will help to build your mental image of the cube (making it easier to visualise how the later, more complex stages work) and also help shave off precious seconds that you don't need to waste rotating the whole cube.

## The White Corners

### Introduction 1

Now that we have the white cross created, in this step we will place the white corners and complete the first layer. This step can also be solved intuitively if you are up for the challenge however if you are not then keep reading below to see how it's done.

Some people like to solve this step of the Rubik's cube with the white cross facing down. Some people like to solve it with the white cross facing up. Either way is fine. We will demonstrate here with the white cross facing down because it will be easier to see what is happening (the corner you are trying to place you can see all 3 sides of) but you can easily adjust the algorithms to work with the cube flipped.

You have a bit of flexibility with this stage. There are two methods you can approach slotting the pieces into place with. Use whichever you find suits you best.

### The White Corners 1

For both of these approaches you want to line up the white corner piece directly above the corner it needs to be slotted into. The corner piece may be in one of three orientations:
对于这两种方法，您都需要将白色角件直接对准需要插入的角的上方。角件可以有以下三种方向之一：

Fortunately both of these methods will twist the piece around if you repeat them so just keep repeating until the piece is in place in the right orientation. Both of these methods may be performed as a mirror image on the other side of the cube as well.
幸运的是，如果重复这两种方法，魔方都会发生扭曲，因此只需不断重复，直到魔方处于正确的方向。这两种方法也可以在魔方的另一侧以镜像方式执行。

For each algorithm, rotate the cube until the piece you want to place is on your front right. These algorithms work with your right hand manipulating the cube (though you can mirror the algorithms to perform them with your left hand as well). After the piece is placed, rotate the cube so the next corner to place is aligned to your front right.
对于每个算法，旋转立方体，直到您想要放置的块位于您的右前方。这些算法适用于用右手操纵立方体（尽管您也可以镜像算法以用左手执行它们）。放置块后，旋转立方体，使下一个要放置的角与右前方对齐。

### Method 1

One thing you'll notice in a lot of these algorithms is that there is a symmetry to them.

In the above algorithm the last two steps are the opposite of the first two steps and in the opposite order. This makes it easier to remember.

If the white corner you are placing is not the right way around that's ok. Just repeat the algorithm until it is.

### Method 2

This one has two steps. One for orienting(使适应；确定方向；使朝东) the piece correctly and one for then slotting it into place.一个用于正确定位部件，另一个用于将其插入到位。

The two algorithms are very similar however so remembering them is not that difficult.

To orient the piece we use the following algorithm after placing the piece directly above the corner it is to be slotted into.

Keep doing this algorithm until the white panel is facing you. Then perform the algorithm below. It is the same algorithm with the fourth step removed.

### Taking things further

The algorithms above use your right hand to do the manipulation. See if you can do the same manipulations with your left hand. This is useful for getting faster as sometimes the pieces aren't in the right orientation for the right hand but are for the left hand. Rather than move to the right hand and reorient until it is correct you can straight away place the piece with your left hand.

## Step Three

Now that we have the white face completed and the center pieces of the second layer in place all we need to do to complete the second layer is place the second layer edge pieces.
现在我们已经完成了白色表面，并且第二层的中心部分已就位，接下来要完成第二层，我们需要做的就是放置第二层的边缘部分。

This turns out to be relatively easy. 这其实相对容易。

This step is essentially just a single algorithm and its corresponding mirror image. 这一步本质上只是一个单一算法及其对应的镜像。

Just like in the previous step we will rotate the cube so that the second layer edge we want to place is on the face facing us.
就像上一步一样，我们将旋转立方体，以便我们要放置的第二层边缘位于面向我们的面上。

Next we will line up（排成一行） the piece we want to place there on the top layer also facing us.
 下一步，我们将把想要放置在最顶层并面向我们的部分排列起来。

Then it is a matter of slotting it in by either moving it down and left or down and right by using the following algorithms.然后，使用以下算法，通过向下和向左移动或向下和向右移动来将其插入。

### Down and to the Right

### Down and to the Left

Now you might be asking "but what if that piece was the other way around? (ie. with the orange panel on top)" That's ok. 现在您可能会问“但是如果那部分是反过来的呢？（即橙色面板在上面）”没关系。

All we need to do is rotate the cube so that the blue face is pointing towards us, line up the piece with the blue face then perform the mirrow image of the algorithm to slot it in down and to the left like so.我们需要做的就是旋转立方体，使蓝色面指向我们，将碎片与蓝色面对齐，然后执行算法的镜像，将其插入到左下方，就像这样。

### Getting a piece out of the second layer

Some of the pieces we want to place will be in the top layer but most likely some of them will also be in the second layer (but in the wrong place or in the right place but wrong orientation).
我们要放置的部分会放在顶层，但很可能其中有些也会放在第二层（但位置不对或位置正确但方向错误）。

It's easiest to start with any pieces which are on the top layer and then deal with the other pieces next.最简单的方法是先处理顶层的部分，然后再处理其他部分。

If you are lucky you'll move some of the incorrect second layer pieces up to the top layer in the process and save yourself some time.如果幸运的话，您会在此过程中将一些错误的第二层碎片移至顶层，从而节省一些时间。

When you get stuck however you may use the same algorithms as above to put another piece into the place where the piece is you want to get to the top layer.

That will also move the piece on the second layer up to the top layer.

In the example below we want to get the red/green edge out of the second layer to the top layer.

### Taking things further

For extra flexibility, once you are comfortable with these algorithms, see if you can apply them to the face pointing away from you without rotating the cube. This can save you valuable（有价值的） time.

## The Yellow Face

### Introduction

In this step we will get all the pieces in the top layer with their yellow panel on the top face. We are then set up to complete the cube in the final step.

This is done in two stages, first the yellow cross, then the yellow corners.

### The Yellow Cross

The cube will be in one of three states:
  
    - No yellow edge panels on the yellow face
    - Two yellow edge panels on the yellow face directly opposite each other
    - Two yellow edge panels on the yellow face adjacent to each other

> tip: You will never have just a single yellow edge panel on the yellow face. If you end up in this scenario someone has twisted a piece on your cube and it is in an unsolvable state.
> 提示：黄色面上永远不会只有一块黄色边缘板。如果出现这种情况，则有人扭曲了你的魔方上的一块，导致其处于无法解决的状态。

Thankfully, creating the cross involves one algorithm which is just repeated until successful.

If you have 2 adjacent yellow panels this is ideal and allows you to create the yellow cross with a single iteration of the algorithm. 如果有 2 个相邻的黄色面板，这是理想的，并允许您通过算法的一次迭代来创建黄色十字。

Start by rotating the top face so the two yellow panels are oriented as below. 首先旋转顶面，使两个黄色面板的方向如下所示。

> tip: You'll notice that the second 3 moves in the algorithm are the opposite of the first 3 but in a different order. Realising this can make it easier to remember. 你会注意到算法中的后 3 个动作与前 3 个动作相反，但顺序不同。意识到这一点可以让你更容易记住

If you have 3 yellow panels in a row like below then align the yellow panels horizontally like below, then apply the same algorithm to create the scenario(n. 方案；情节；剧本) above. Then repeat and you're done. 如果有 3 个相邻的黄色面板，如下所示，则将黄色面板水平对齐，然后将相同的算法应用于上述场景。然后重复，你就完成了.

If you have no yellow panels on the top face then apply the algorithm once which will create a line of yellow panels, then align horizontally and repeat the algorithm to create a yellow L, then repeat again to create the cross.

### The Yellow Corners

Solving the yellow corners is also a matter of applying a single algorithm repeatedly until you get the desired result. Between each iteration of the algorithm you will need to rotate the top layer to align it correctly.

If you have the layout as below then a single iteration of the algorithm will solve the yellow layer. (note the orientation of the three yellow panels which are not on the top face.)

> tip: Remembering this algorithm becomes easier when you see it as a pattern of flipping back and forth between U and alternating R and R' moves. 你会记住这个算法会变得更容易，当你看到它作为翻转 U 和交替 R 和 R' 移动的模式时。

For all other states just keep repeating the algorithm and rotating the top face until you create the layout above. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:

    - If no corners have their top panel yellow then rotate the top layer until the top left panel on the left face is yellow.
    - If one corner is yellow on the top face, keep repeating the algorithm until you have a full yellow face.
    - If you have two yellow corners (in any orientation) then rotate the top layer until the top left panel on the front face is yellow and perform(执行) the algorithm.

### Taking things further

The two algorithms used in this step use the F, U and R moves. With practice you can perform combinations of these moves rather quickly. Spending some time practicing to get these algorithms smooth and fast will really help to reduce your cube solving time.

## The Final Layer

You're almost there. In this final step you will rearrange the pieces on the top layer to get them all in place.

This will be done in two stages. The first stage involves putting the corner pieces in the right place. The second stage involves putting the edge pieces in the right place. Then we are done.

### Top Layer Corners

The following algorithm will switch the front two corner pieces. You will probably need to apply this algorithm a few times to line up all the corners.

Inspect your cube:

- If all the corners are already lined up you are in luck, you can skip this stage entirely. (though you have to be quite lucky for this to happen)
- If two corners are already lined up you are in luck. All you need to do is rotate the top layer to place the other two at the front, then a single iteration of the algorithm to switch them.
- If none of the above then you'll have to apply the algorithm twice.

> This is a large algorithm which can be difficult to remember. It can help if you brake it down into stages and try to think of it in descriptive terms as per the comments above.如果您将其分解为几个阶段并尝试按照上述评论以描述性术语进行思考，可能会有所帮助。

### Top Layer Edges

Similar to the previous stage, this stage may need to be repeated several times to get everything to line up.

This algorithm will rotate the left edge, right edge and front edge of the top layer either clockwise or anti clockwise. Here is the algorithm rotating the pieces clockwise.

> Tip: Remembering this algorithm becomes easier when you see it as a pattern of flipping back and forth between U and alternating R and R' moves. 你会记住这个算法会变得更容易，当你看到它作为翻转 U 和交替 R 和 R' 移动的模式时.

For all other states just keep repeating the algorithm and rotating the top face until you create the layout above. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:

    If no corners have their top panel yellow then rotate the top layer until the top left panel on the left face is yellow.
    If one corner is yellow on the top face, keep repeating the algorithm until you have a full yellow face.
    If you have two yellow corners (in any orientation) then rotate the top layer until the top left panel on the front face is yellow and perform the algorithm.

### Taking things further

Now you know how to solve the Rubik's cube. Congratulations. The next step is to keep practicing. It will probably take you a bit before you can solve all the layers without having to refer back to the algorithms. Keep trying to work through as much of the solution as you can without referring back to the algorithms and only do so when you get stuck.现在您知道如何解决魔方了。恭喜您。下一步是继续练习。您可能需要花一点时间才能解决所有层，而无需参考算法。继续尝试在不参考算法的情况下尽可能多地解决解决方案，只有在遇到困难时才这样做。

Check out our Cheat Sheet for a quick reference with all the steps on one page.请查看我们的备忘单，以获得一页上包含所有步骤的快速参考。

Once you have this down, the next step, if you want to improve your speed is to combine the solving of the first and second layer into one step (steps 2 and 3 of this tutorial). This is an approach called F2L or First two Layers. With a bit of practice you can do this intuitively and it will drop your times by a considerable amount.一旦你搞定了这一点，如果你想提高速度，下一步就是将第一层和第二层的解决合并为一步（本教程的第 2 步和第 3 步）。这种方法称为 F2L 或前两层。经过一些练习，你可以直观地做到这一点，这将大大缩短你的时间。
