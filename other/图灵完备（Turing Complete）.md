# 图灵完备（Turing Complete）

"Turing complete" is a term used in computer science to describe a system or language that can perform any computation that a Turing machine can.

A Turing machine is an abstract mathematical model of computation that can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, no matter how complex.

For a system to be Turing complete, it must be able to:

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (such as addition and subtraction).
- Have conditional branching (if-then-else statements).
- Have looping or repetition (such as for loops or while loops).
- Have the ability to store and retrieve data (variables or memory).

Languages like C, Java, Python, and many others are considered Turing complete because they can express any computable function or algorithm given enough time and resources. 

Even simpler systems like cellular automata or certain programming languages designed for educational purposes can also be Turing complete if they meet the criteria mentioned above.

一切可计算的问题都能计算，这样的虚拟机或者编程语言就叫图灵完备的。当然图灵完备也可能因为陷入死循环而导致程序崩溃。

图灵完备和图灵不完备各有其优势，图灵不完备会更安全些，图灵完备会更智能些。
